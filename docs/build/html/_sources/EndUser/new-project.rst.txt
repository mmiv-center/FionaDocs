-----------------------------------------

Apply for a new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to apply for a new project on the research information system (research PACS)
please fill out the application form available under “**Apply for a new research project**”

Additional user access can be requested by the principal investigator of the project under
|fiona-apply_link| (|fiona-apply_url|) “**Apply for access to an existing project**”.

If you encounter any problems with applying for access, contact |admin_email|.



Access to REDCap for structured data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our project uses |redcap-main_link| as an electronic data capture solution. Projects on the research information system can receive access to their RedCap project as well as access to the image data viewing (see next section).



Access to the “Sectra DMA Forskning” research PACS viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access to the image data is provided by your |it_link|. Such access may require a valid local hospital user account and a laptop or PACS workstation that is under control of IT Department. If you contact IT Departmetn ask for the start menu item “**Sectra DMA Forskning**”. With the program and your hospital username and password you will gain access to the research picture archive and communication system (PACS).

Without access to a specific research project you will not see any data in the research PACS. Each research projects requires specific permissions to become accessible for a user.

The research PACS viewer is using a separate clinical PACS software installation (Sectra IDS7). In order to prevent possible interactions between the clinical and the research PACS only one of the application can run at a given time. You will be logged out of the clinical PACS if you start the research PACS viewer.
